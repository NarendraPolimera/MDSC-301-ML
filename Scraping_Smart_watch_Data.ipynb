              "[\"[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback 😀 and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.\",\n",

The heart rate sensor is accurate as expected. The build quality seems good and perfectly fitted to my hand. The UI is simple to use. Music controlling, Spo2 and so many sports modes are working fine. The battery backup given is 10 days, a good thing while travelling.

It is so cool looking and have almost all the features that anyone can look for in a smartwatch...But IDK what happens with boAt\\'s software, I\\'m facing two vital issues with the device that forced to raise a replacement issue.1. Battery back up is sooooo bad. It didn\\'t even last for one full day (24 hours at least) with low/moderate usage. I charged the device at 100% before going to sleep and switched it off. When I woke up in the morning, it showed that it has only 70% of battery available... Remember, the device was completely powered of at night!!!After using it throughout the evening on 26thJuly (with NO CALL), it decreased from 100% to 80% in 1 hour!!2. Bluetooth connection is not working... Phone is getting paired to boAt wearables app easily but somehow it is not showing \"Bluetooth connected\" icon in device ... Also I\\'m unable to make/manage any call via this device except for the reject option...I tried resetting for multiple times but it doesn\\'t work... I made a replacement request on 26th July and waiting for a fresh product.Apart from that, the watch is beautiful indeed... The display, custom watch faces option, sport modes, alarm, camera, stopwatch, heart rate monitor, oxygen monitor, seeing notifications of your choices...P.S.: Today is 17th August & I have received my replacement product... This time, the watch connects to device bluetooth at a glance by \"CALL_BT\" & everything seemed fine... But that was first and last time I guess ... The watch never get it\\'s bluetooth calling connected again!!!!Tried multiple reset and re-installing software but didn\\'t work... So, Returning!!!!!!!!!boAt, it\\'s tough to gain Customer\\'s trust & faith, but it\\'s that so easy to destroy... And you are doing the same..... Your end is near, be prepared....',\n",
